# Experiment 1
Establish proof of concept by constructing artificial tensors with cp structure for the following general types of data:
- Normal
- Binary
- Count
- Non-negative

## Basic construction
The following foundational components apply to all experiments:
- Only apply relavent loss functions for each type of data
- Include cp-opt results for a "baseline"
- Same initialization for separate loss functions
- More??
